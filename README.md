PPK (Password as Private Key) is a lightweight file encryption tool.
It utilizes K-163 ECC public key for key exchange and 128-bit AES as
the data encryption algorithm.
PPK derives the private key from your password and then uses it to
calculates the associated public key. 
The public key is presented in base-32 as a short string:

    {TK90W3ML8HPZFE9ASK1SFYL9EBUSC2WG06KW/john}
    {HBLYZLE4ZMK8KHSLPFKR5C9FL75S5G12Z6HR/mike}

Using PPK, you can use someone's public key to encrypt a file. The
person who knows the associated passord is able to decrypt this file.
